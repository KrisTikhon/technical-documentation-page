          The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or
          house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.
          Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
          domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.
          Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and
          neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
          resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
          extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species. As of 2017, the
          domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States,
          with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning
          at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat,
          with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As
          of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million
          stray cats in the world.

          The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a
          common ancestor about 10–15 million years ago. The genus Felis
          diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago. Results of
          phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved
          through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat
          evolved through artificial selection. The domesticated cat and its
          closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes and
          roughly 20,000 genes. The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was
          tamed independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of partially
          domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of
          today.

          Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including
          purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several
          different forms of meowing. Their body language, including position of
          ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws,
          are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly
          important social signal mechanisms in cats. A raised tail indicates a
          friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicate hostility. Tail-raising
          also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy,
          with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than
          subordinate ones. Feral cats are generally silent.: 208  Nose-to-nose
          touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social
          grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting
          its head. Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a
          signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing
          kittens, who are thought to use it as a care-soliciting signal.
          Post-nursing cats also often purr as a sign of contentment: when being
          petted, becoming relaxed,[106][107] or eating. Even though purring is
          popularly interpreted as indicative of pleasure, it has been recorded
          in a wide variety of circumstances, most of which involve physical
          contact between the cat and another, presumably trusted individual.
          Some cats have been observed to purr continuously when chronically ill
          or in apparent pain.

          The domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of
          the world. It is adaptable and now present on all continents except
          Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the
          isolated Kerguelen Islands. Due to its ability to thrive in almost any
          terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species.It
          lives on small islands with no human inhabitants. Feral cats can live
          in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land,
          scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.

          Ferality. Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have
          reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans
          and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral cats is
          not known, but estimates of the United States feral population range
          from 25 to 60 million. Feral cats may live alone, but most are found
          in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually
          associated with a source of food. Famous feral cat colonies are found
          in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats at some of
          these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.

          Impact on wildlife. On islands, birds can contribute as much as 60% of
          a cat's diet. In nearly all cases, the cat cannot be identified as the
          sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some
          instances, eradication of cats has caused a "mesopredator release"
          effect where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of
          smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey.
          Domestic cats are a contributing factor to the decline of many
          species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to
          extinction. The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, and the New Zealand
          merganser are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being
          the flightless Lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few
          years after its discovery. One feral cat in New Zealand killed 102 New
          Zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven days. In the US, feral and
          free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3 – 22.3 billion
          mammals annually.

          Vision. A tabby cat with a third, translucent eyelid covering part of
          either eye A cat's nictitating membrane shown as it blinks Cats have
          excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level
          required for human vision. 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes
          having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through
          the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity
          to dim light. Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The
          domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light
          without chromatic aberration. At low light, a cat's pupils expand to
          cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. The domestic cat has
          rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized
          for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to
          distinguish between red and green is limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing. The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500
          Hz to 32 kHz.[70] It can detect an extremely broad range of
          frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only
          detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of
          10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9
          octaves.[71][72] Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large
          movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect
          the location of a noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smell. Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their
          well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa,
          about 5.8 square centimetres in area, which is about twice that of
          humans. Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their
          mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening. It allows
          them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot. Cats are
          sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, which
          they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent
          glands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taste. Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or
          so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue). Domestic and wild cats
          share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds
          from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to
          taste sweetness. They, however, possess taste bud receptors
          specialized for acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes.
          Their taste buds possess the receptors needed to detect umami.
          However, these receptors contain molecular changes that make the cat
          taste of umami different from that of humans. In humans, they detect
          the amino acids of glutamic acid and aspartic acid, but in cats they
          instead detect nucleotides, in this case inosine monophosphate and
          l-Histidine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whiskers. To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of
          movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces.
          These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of
          objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing
          air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect
          the eyes from damage.
